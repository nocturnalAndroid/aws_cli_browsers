.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcwbrowser\fR provides an interactive terminal interface for browsing AWS CloudWatch log groups and log streams using fzf. It facilitates navigation, viewing log events in different formats, and downloading logs.

It utilizes caching for log group lists to improve startup speed and maintains a list of recently accessed groups for quick navigation. It also supports searching for specific log streams across recent groups.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fI<log-group-name>\fR [\fI<log-stream-name>\fR]
Optionally start browsing directly within a specific log group. If \fI<log-stream-name>\fR is also provided, it attempts to directly show actions for that specific stream within the group.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR
Display a help message summarizing usage and options, then exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-uninstall\fR
Prompts for confirmation and then runs the uninstall script located at `$HOME/.local/bin/awsclibrowser-uninstall`, removing both `s3browser` and `cwbrowser`.
.TP
\fB\-\-clear\-cache\fR [\fB\-\-all\fR]
Removes the cache directory for the currently active AWS profile, located at `$HOME/.cwbrowser/$AWS_PROFILE_NAME`. This clears cached log group lists and recent group history for that profile. If the \fB\-\-all\fR flag is provided, it removes the entire `$HOME/.cwbrowser` directory, clearing caches for all profiles.
.TP
\fB\-\-search\-stream\fR \fI<stream_name>\fR, \fB\-s\fR \fI<stream_name>\fR
Searches for a log stream exactly matching \fI<stream_name>\fR within the log groups listed in the recent cache (`$HOME/.cwbrowser/$AWS_PROFILE_NAME/recent_groups.txt`). If found, it navigates directly to that log group and stream. If not found, it prints an error and exits.

.SH INTERACTIVE USAGE
When run without arguments, \fBcwbrowser\fR first displays a list of CloudWatch Log Groups accessible by the configured AWS credentials and region. The list is fetched from AWS or loaded from a cache. Recently accessed groups are listed first, marked with `[RECENT]`.

.SS Navigation
.IP \(bu 2
Use arrow keys (Up/Down) or type characters to filter the list of log groups or log streams.
.IP \(bu 2
Press Enter to select a highlighted item. Selecting a log group displays its log streams.
.IP \(bu 2
In the log stream view, select '..' to return to the log group list.
.IP \(bu 2
Press Ctrl+C at any selection prompt to exit the current view (e.g., return to group list from stream view) or exit the application entirely.

.SS Log Stream Actions
When a log stream is selected, a menu of actions is presented:
.IP \(bu 2
\fBView logs (Message only)\fR: Fetches log events and displays only the message field, piped through `less`.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBView logs (Timestamp + Message)\fR: Fetches log events and displays the formatted timestamp and message for each, piped through `less`.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBView logs (Raw JSON)\fR: Fetches log events and displays the raw JSON output from the AWS CLI, piped through `less`.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDownload logs as JSON\fR: Prompts for a local file path (defaults to `./<stream_name>.json`) and saves the raw JSON log event data to that file.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDownload logs as Text (Message only)\fR: Prompts for a local file path (defaults to `./<stream_name>.txt`) and saves only the message field of each log event to that file.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDownload logs as CSV\fR: Prompts for a local file path (defaults to `./<stream_name>.csv`) and saves the logs as a CSV file with "timestamp" and "message" columns.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCopy stream name\fR: Copies the selected log stream name to the system clipboard (uses `pbcopy` on macOS).
.IP \(bu 2
\fB..\fR: Cancels the action menu and returns to the log stream list.

.SH CACHING
.IP \(bu 2
Log group lists are cached per AWS profile to speed up startup. The cache is stored in `$HOME/.cwbrowser/$AWS_PROFILE_NAME/log_groups.txt`.
.IP \(bu 2
The cache is updated in the background after displaying the initial list. Errors during background updates are logged to `$HOME/.cwbrowser/$AWS_PROFILE_NAME/cache_errors.log`.
.IP \(bu 2
A list of recently accessed log groups is maintained at `$HOME/.cwbrowser/$AWS_PROFILE_NAME/recent_groups.txt`.
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fB\-\-clear\-cache\fR to remove the cache for the current profile or \fB\-\-clear\-cache \-\-all\fR for all profiles.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fI$HOME/.cwbrowser/$AWS_PROFILE_NAME/\fR
Directory used to cache log group lists (`log_groups.txt`, `group_names.txt`), recent group history (`recent_groups.txt`), and cache update errors (`cache_errors.log`) for the specified AWS profile.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBAWS_PROFILE\fR
If set, specifies the AWS named profile to use for credentials and configuration. If unset, the 'default' profile is used. The cache is segregated based on this profile name.

.SH DEPENDENCIES
.TP
\fBaws\fR(1)
The AWS Command Line Interface is required for all CloudWatch Logs operations. It must be configured with valid credentials.
.TP
\fBfzf\fR(1)
A command-line fuzzy finder is required for the interactive selection menus.
